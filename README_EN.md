You can know more about Piping Server [here](https://github.com/nwtgck/piping-server/tree/develop)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the following dependencies:

- `curl`
- `yq`
- `uuidgen`
- `pbcopy`

If not, install them by using your package manager (Pacman, APT, Yum, etc).

You will need a Piping Server, you can use ours:

```bash
bash main.sh
```
