You can know more about Piping Server [here](https://github.com/nwtgck/piping-server/tree/develop)

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have installed the following dependencies:

-   `curl`
-   `yq`
-   `uuidgen`

If not install them by using your package manager (Pacman, APT, Yum, etc).

You will need a Piping Server, you can use ours:

```
